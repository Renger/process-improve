    "## Why do we build linear regression models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical data is collected and a relationship between the input $x$ and the output $y$ is calculated. This relationship is often a linear regression model, written as $y = b_0 + b_1x$, where the intercept is $b_0$ and the slope is $b_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is most often to use that calculated relationship and based on it, is then to make a prediction of some future output, $\\hat{y}$, given a new input: $\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x_\\text{new}$\n",
    "\n",
    "As said, this is the most comment reason for building that linear regression model. So here are some ways a linear regression model is commonly used: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. to learn more about what this relationship between input and output is\n",
    "2. to later turn the model around, and find the input, in order to get a desired output (i.e. using the model in the backwards direction)\n",
    "3. and by far the most common usage: to get predictions of the output, based on the inputs (i.e. use the model in the forwards direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at each of these in turn."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Learning more about the relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient, $b_1$ of the linear regression $y = b_0 + b_1 x$, shows the average effect on the output, $y$, for a one unit increase in the input $x$. This is called \"learning about our system\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you built a regression model between $x = $ temperature measured in Celsius of your system (input) and the $y=$ pH (output) you might get a regression model of $$ y=4.5 + 0.12 x_1$$\n",
    "from which you learn two things:\n",
    "* that every 1 degree increase in temperature, leads, on average, to an increase of pH by 0.12 units\n",
    "* that the expected pH when using a temperature of $x = 0$ degrees Celsius, leads to an output pH of 4.5 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "But consider two cases: what if I told you the $R^2$ of this model was 0.2, or it was 0.94. How does this change your learnings? We will come to this in the next section, where we understand a bit more what $R^2$ is measuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the model in the backwards direction\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue the above example, at what temperature do we operate the system to reach a pH of $y=5.7$? Provided we keep things constant at the same conditions as when we acquired the historical data to build the model [that is far-reaching requirement], we can turn the model around, and calculate that $$x = \\dfrac{y - 4.5}{0.12}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, consider two cases of a low and high $R^2$: how reliable is this usage of the regression model under those 2 scenarios?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the model's predictions \n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario is the one most people are familiar with. Continuing the above, it is asking what the expected (or predicted) pH would be for a given new input value of temperature, $x$. For example, at a new temperature that we have never operated at before of 13¬∞C, we expect an output pH of $4.5 + 0.12 \\times 13 = 6.06$ pH units.\n",
    "\n",
    "And again, what value do we have from a model with an $R^2$ which is around 0.2, or a model with $R^2$ of 0.94?"

    "The $R^2$ value has multiple interpretations. Here are two.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One interpretation of $R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, it is nothing more than a measure of how strongly two variables are correlated. It is the square root of the correlation coefficient between $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{R^2} = r(x, y) = \\dfrac{\\mathcal{E}\\left\\{ (x - \\overline{x}) (y - \\overline{y})\\right\\}}{\\sqrt{\\mathcal{V}\\left\\{x\\right\\}\\mathcal{V}\\left\\{y\\right\\}}} = \\dfrac{\\text{Cov}\\left\\{x, y\\right\\}}{\\sqrt{\\mathcal{V}\\left\\{x\\right\\}\\mathcal{V}\\left\\{y\\right\\}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "* $\\mathcal{E}$ is the \"expected value of\", \n",
    "* $\\mathcal{V}$ is the \"variance of\", and\n",
    "* $\\text{Cov}\\left\\{x, y\\right\\}$ is the \"covariance of\" operation; and\n",
    "* the lines above $x$ and $y$ means to calculate the average value of those data. In other words, $\\overline{y}$ is the average value of all the training $y$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another interpretation of $R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "A further interpretation is that $R^2$ is the ratio of the Regression Sum of Squares (RegSS) to the Total Sum of Squares (TSS). \n",
    "\n",
    "$$R^2 = \\dfrac{\\text{RegSS}}{\\text{TSS}} = \\dfrac{\\sum_i{ \\left(\\hat{y}_i - \\overline{y}\\right)^2}}{\\sum_i{ \\left(y_i - \\overline{y}\\right)^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "showing that a $R^2$ value of 1.0 means the predictions, $\\hat{y}_i$, are identically equally to the original values, $y_i$. Conversely to make $R^2$ have a value of 0.0, the predictions are simply equal to a flat line, $\\overline{y}$, the average value of $y$, no matter what the input value of $x$. This is the worst model you can have: it says the best prediction you can make for $y$ is just to return the average value of the training $y$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Yet another interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to the prior interpretation, so it isn't really new, is that $$R^2 = 1-\\dfrac{\\text{RSS}}{\\text{TSS}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "coming from that fact that for a simple regression model we have TSS = RegSS + RSS. The RSS is the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), or mathematically RSS = $\\sum_i{ \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also shows nicely that to get an $R^2$ of 1.0 you must have no residuals; or an $R^2$ of 0.0 means that your TSS = RSS, in other words, your residuals are as big as the raw data themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary so far\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very fruitful to understand the above formulas and try to interpret them yourself, in plain language. It is not easy at first, but it pays off understanding how you can make each part of the equations bigger and smaller."

    "## Why $R^2$ is not sufficient to judge a model's regression performance\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above, here are two very simple reasons why $R^2$ is not the correct metric to judge how well you can predict a new output, $y$, from a new input $x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you switch the historical data around, and make $y$ the $x$ and let $x$ become $y$, then you get ***exactly the same*** $R^2$ value. That does not make sense. A metric of a model's prediction ability **must** depend on what is the input and the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What if I told you that I can tell you what the $R^2$ value will be, before even calculating the model's slope and intercept? Again, that does not make sense. How can a good metric of prediction performance be calculated before even fitting the prediction model? \n",
    "\n",
    "The above would be the equivalent of calculating the prediction ability of a neural network before even fitting it; or flipping the input and outputs around and getting the same performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we make these two very strong statements that show $R^2$ is not useful? Look back at the first formula for $R^2$:\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{R^2} = r(x, y) = \\dfrac{\\mathcal{E}\\left\\{ (x - \\overline{x}) (y - \\overline{y})\\right\\}}{\\sqrt{\\mathcal{V}\\left\\{x\\right\\}\\mathcal{V}\\left\\{y\\right\\}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Switching $x$ and $y$ around\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerator is symmetrical. If you switch the roles of $x$ and $y$ you get the same numerator value. This also holds for the denominator. You can also check it in Python, Excel, R, MATLAB, or whatever tool you use for linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Able to calculate $R^2$ before even fitting the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, take a second look at the above formula. Does it depend on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the model's residuals? ***No***\n",
    "* any of the model's coefficients, such as the slope or intercept? ***No***\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is possible to calculate $R^2$ without even fitting a model. This is not some mathematical trick, because things cancel out, or simplify in some special way. It is simply a fact of what $R^2$ is designed to measure: the degree of correlation between two sequences of measurements $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So quite simply, that last sentence indicates when $R^2$ should be calculated, and for when it should actually be used (and by extension for when it should not be used).\n"
