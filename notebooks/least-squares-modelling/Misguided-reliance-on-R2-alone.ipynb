    "\n",
    "1. to learn more about what this relationship between inputs and output is\n",
    "2. to later turn the model around, and find the inputs, in order to get a desired output (i.e. using the model in the backwards direction)\n",
    "3. and then the most common reason: to get good predictions of the output, based on the inputs (i.e. in the forwards direction).\n",

    "\n",
    "The coefficient, $b_1$ of the linear regression $y = b_0 + b_1 x_1$, shows the average effect on the output, $y$, for a one unit increase in the input $x_1$. This is learning about our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you built a regression model between $x_1 = $ temperature measured in Celsius of your system (input) and the $y=$ pH (output) you   might get a regression model of $$ y=4.5 + 0.12 x_1$$\n",
    "from which you learn two things:\n",
    "* that every 1 degree increase in temperature, leads, on average, to an increase of pH by 0.12 units\n",
    "* that the expected pH when using a temperature of $x_1 = 0$ degrees Celsius, leads to an output pH of 4.5 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "But consider two cases: what if I told you the $R^2$ of this model was 0.2, or it was 0.94. How does this change your learnings? We will come to this in the next section, where we learn what $R^2$ is measuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the model in the backwards direction\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue the above example, at what temperature do we operate the system to reach a pH of $y=5.7$? Provided we keep things constant at the same conditions as when we acquired the historical data to build the model [that is far-reaching requirement], we can turn the model around, and calculate that $$x = \\dfrac{y - 4.5}{0.12}$$\n",

    "This scenario is the one most people are familiar with. Continuing the above, it is asking what the expected (or predicted) pH would be for a given new input value of temperature, $x_1$. For example, at a new temperature that we have never operated at before of 13¬∞C, we expect an output pH of $4.5 + 0.12 \\times 13 = 6.06$ pH units.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. If you switch the historical data around, and make $y$ the $x$ and let $x$ become $y$, then you get ***exactly the same*** $R^2$ value. That does not make sense. A metric of a model's prediction ability **must** depend on what is the input and the output.\n",
    "2. What if I told you that I can tell you what the $R^2$ value will be, before even calculating the model's slope and intercept? * That does not make sense. How can a good metric of prediction performance be calculated before even fitting the prediction model? \n",
